# Installation
The code should run with no issue with Anaconda3

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb Open Data to Understand:
1. which region has the highest price?
2. which region has the most Airbnb properties?
3. which region has the highest demand?
4. Based on conclusion from above, if I am a consultant, which region should I advise my client to invest on?

# File Descriptions
There is one notebooks available to show work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The csv file is the public dataset we used for the analysis
